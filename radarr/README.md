Movie organizer/manager for usenet and torrent users.

## About

[Radarr] is a movie collection manager for Usenet and BitTorrent users. It can
monitor multiple RSS feeds for new movies and will interface with clients and
indexers to grab, sort, and rename them. It can also be configured to
automatically upgrade the quality of existing files in the library when
a better quality format becomes available.
